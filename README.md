<h1 style="color:red;">TouristGuide & LocationsApi Overview</h1>

TouristGuide is an Android application developed with Xamarin Android. It allows users to explore tourist attractions in Greece by displaying them on a map with markers. Users can click on a marker to view an image, read a description, and play a sound recording describing the sight. Additionally, if a user's current location is close to the sight, the sound recording will play automatically.


LocationsMarker Api is a web application that enables administrators to create and manage tourist attraction locations that will be used by TouristGuide app to present the sights to the users. Administrators can provide information such as the name, area, postal code, description, image, and sound recording for each location. They can also set the distance at which the sound recording will play automatically for the Android application users.
