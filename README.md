TouristGuide & LocationsApi Overview

TouristGuide is an Android application developed with Xamarin Android. It allows users to explore tourist attractions in Greece by displaying them on a map with markers. Users can click on a marker to view an image, read a description, and play a sound recording describing the sight. Additionally, if a user's current location is close to the sight, the sound recording will play automatically.


LocationsApi is a web application that enables administrators to create and manage tourist attraction locations. Administrators can provide information such as the name, area, postal code, description, image, and sound recording for each location. They can also set the distance at which the sound recording will play automatically for the Android application users. The Android application fetches data from this API to present it to the user.

Use Cases

1. Login to the application. Go to Locations and Create New. Select a location on the map and then fill in the form. Don't forget the 'meters to notify' field
